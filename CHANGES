Version 1.4
-----------

- Added Password support (PASS command. Password could be changed in the ./src/connections.c file the default password is: "nettraf"
- Added Support that the Client could display the current ip of the selected interface (IPADDR command)

Version 1.3.1
-------------
- Some people had problems with the LIBWRAP library, so I turned it off by default. Enable it on the Makefile (src/Makefile) if you want it.

Version 1.3
-----------
- Can use TCP WRAPPERS to add some level of security to the program. If you want this, enable it at the Makefile on the src directory. (thanks to James B. MacLean <macleajb@EDnet.NS.CA> for implementing this)
- New commands for really large traffic networks. Instead of sending all the bytes received since the interface is up, now it sends only the amount of bytes changed since the previous second. Look for 1.3 clients that uses this feature. Should work on all networks now, unless you have a 4GB/s connection! ;) (I'm sure I'll find someone one day or another)

Version 1.2
-----------
(this version was not released)
- I really messed up the program on this version, tried to do too many things and the thing blow up... so I threw it all away and get back to the 1.1 version... one less bloatware on the world! ;)

Version 1.1
-----------
- Can now run as a REAL daemon with the -D parameter (thanks to J. Gregory Rebholz <rebholz@cs.fsu.edu> for telling me my daemon was not a daemon ;) )
- Added 2 parameters: -v (show version); -D (run as daemon)
- In daemon mode, all messages go to syslog with the name "nettrafd"
- Now the client is distributed outside the server file
- The data is now processed internally as long long (8 bytes). I never thought someone would download more than 2GB of data using a PPP interface, but on the first day I put this program on the Internet, J. Gregory Rebholz complained, as his byte count was at 3GB! ;) (special care should be taken on the client applications, as they must be able to handle these big values)
- Included an init script to start nettrafd at the computer startup

Version 1.0
-----------
- Added information files, and headers to all source files

Version 0.1 (unreleased)
------------------------
- Initial version.
